1 Executive Summary
This Validation Report (VR) is intended to assist the end user of this product and any security
certification Agent for that end user in determining the suitability of this Information Technology
(IT) product for their environment. End users should review the Security Target (ST), which is
where specific security claims are made, in conjunction with this VR, which describes how those
security claims were tested and evaluated and any restrictions on the evaluated configuration.
Prospective users should carefully read the Assumptions and Clarification of Scope in Section 5
and the Validator Comments in Section 10, where any restrictions on the evaluated configuration
are highlighted.
This report documents the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) assessment of the
evaluation of the Splunk Enterprise 8.1 Series Target of Evaluation (TOE). It presents the
evaluation results, their justifications, and the conformance results. This VR is not an
endorsement of the TOE by any agency of the U.S. Government and no warranty of the TOE is
either expressed or implied. This VR applies only to the specific version and configuration of the
product as evaluated and documented in the ST.
The evaluation was completed by Acumen Security in January2021. The information in this
report is largely derived from the Evaluation Technical Report (ETR) and associated test report,
all written by Acumen Security. The evaluation determined that the product is both Common
Criteria Part 2 Extended and Part 3 Extended and meets the assurance requirements defined in
the U.S. Government Protection Profile for Security Requirements for Common Criteria for
Information Technology Security Evaluations Part 1, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April 2017.
The TOE identified in this VR has been evaluated at a NIAP approved Common Criteria Testing
Laboratory (CCTL) using the Common Methodology for IT Security Evaluation (Version 3.1, Rev.
5) for conformance to the Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation (Version 3.1, Rev. 5), as
interpreted by the Assurance Activities contained in the Protection Profile for Application
Software, Version 1.3 [SWAPP v1.3] and Functional Package for Transport Layer Security (TLS),
Version 1.1 [TLS-PKG v1.1]. This VR applies only to the specific version of the TOE as evaluated.
The evaluation has been conducted in accordance with the provisions of the NIAP Common
Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme and the conclusions of the testing laboratory in the
ETR are consistent with the evidence provided.
The validation team provided guidance on technical issues and evaluation processes and
reviewed the individual work units documented in the ETR and the Assurance Activities Report
(AAR). The validation team found that the evaluation showed that the product satisfies all of the
functional requirements and assurance requirements stated in the ST. Based on these findings,
the validation team concludes that the testing laboratory's findings are accurate, the conclusions
justified, and the conformance results are correct. The conclusions of the testing laboratory in
the ETR are consistent with the evidence produced.

3 Architectural Information
ï· The Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the Splunk Enterprise v8.1 which runs on Red Hat
Linux Enterprise (RHEL) v7.7 and v8.2 operating systems. Splunk collects data from
various sources such as systems, devices, and interactions and presents the data for
real time visibility and analysis. The TOE can be configured as a forwarder and an
indexer. When the TOE is configured as the indexer, it will receive data from external
sources such as web services, databases, and one or more instance of Splunk
configured as a Forwarder. In Forwarder configuration, it will transmit all system
generated data to the other instance of Splunk configured as an Indexer.
ï· The TOE is a software application running on Dell PowerEdge R430 Server with Intel
Xeon E5-2630 v4 (Broadwell) processor, and it includes 1TB disk and 32GB RAM. The
TOE is Splunk Enterprise v8.1 which runs on Red Hat Linux Enterprise (RHEL) v7.7 and
v8.2 64-bit operating system.
8
4 Security Policy
Logical Scope of the TOE
The TOE provides the security functionality required by [SWAPP] and [TLS v1.1 package] as listed
below:
4.1 Cryptographic Support
The TOE platform provides HTTPS/TLS functionality to securely communicate with trusted
entities. TOE is shipped with the OpenSSL which performs the TOEâs cryptographic operations.
TOE leverages the services of the underlying platform to generate entropy for deterministic
random bit generator and key store to store the key data.
The following table contains the CAVP algorithm certificates:

Table 3 CAVP Certificate References
4.2 User Data Protection
The TOE is installed on the encrypted partition of the underlying host platform to secure its data.
The private key data for the certificates is stored on the secret storage that can be accessed with
the password set to encrypt the partition. Prior to the installation of TOE, the hard drive on the
host machine should be encrypted using LUKS. The TOE depends on the underlying platform's
network connectivity for its management purpose, sending email alerts to the SMTP server and
9
sending data to the external trusted data feed receiver (TOE Indexer) or receiving the data from
the external trusted data feed (TOE Forwarder).
4.3 Identification and Authentication
The TOE relies on X.509v3 certificate validation functions provided by the platform to
authenticate the certificate(s) during the establishment of the HTTPS/TLS trusted channel. If the
certificate is found to be invalid the TOE rejects such certificate. Certificate with the unknown
revocation status is accepted if the TOE is unable to validate the certificate through CRL.
4.4 Security Management
The TOE is not shipped with the default credentials used for the Initial authentication. Once the
TOE is installed on the RHEL server all the directories and configuration files that are related to
the TOE are protected and has the write access to only the user that performed the installation.
The TOE has several configuration files that makes communication possible between the other
network entities. An administrator can configure the supported TLS cipher suites and curves in
these files for the secure communication with the entities and can also query the TOE version.
4.5 Privacy
The TOE does not request any personally identifiable information (PII) with the intent to transmit
the data over the network, thus maintaining privacy of the security administrators and the users.
4.6 Protection of the TSF
The TOEâs platform performs cryptographic self-tests at startup which ensures the TOEâs ability
to properly operate. The updates must be downloaded manually and installed using the
platformâs package manager. The TOE platform also verifies all software updates via digital
signature wherein the administrator must install the public key of the TOE's developer to check
the integrity of any available updates. The TOE uses platform APIs and includes only 3rd party
libraries. It also implements stack-based buffer overflow protection along with ASLR (address
space layout randomization) and allocating memory for both writing and execution for just-in-
time compilation. The TOE supports SElinux and is one of the pre-requisites before installing the
TOE application.
4.7 Trusted Path/Channels
The TOE is a software application. It supports HTTPS/TLS for secure remote administration
communication for WebUI. HTTPS/TLS is used for secure communication channel between the
TOE indexer and external trusted data feeds (TOE Forwarder), the TOE acting as an Indexer uses
TLS to securely send email alerts to a remote SMTP server. The TOE when configured as a
Forwarder uses HTTPS/TLS for sending data to an external data feed receiver (TOE Indexer).
10
5 Assumptions, Threats, and Clarification of Scope
5.1 Assumptions
The specific conditions listed in the following subsections are assumed to exist in the TOEâs
environment. These assumptions include both practical realities in the development of the TOE
security requirements and the essential environmental conditions on the use of the TOE.
The following assumptions are drawn directly from the [SWAPP]:
ID Assumption
A.PLATFORM The TOE relies upon a trustworthy computing platform with a reliable time clock for
its execution. This includes the underlying platform and whatever runtime
environment it provides to the TOE.
A.PROPER_USER The user of the application software is not willfully negligent or hostile, and uses the
software in compliance with the applied enterprise security policy.
A.PROPER_ADMIN The administrator of the application software is not careless, willfully negligent, or
hostile, and administers the software in compliance with the applied enterprise
security policy.
Table 2 Assumptions
5.2 Threats
The following table lists the threats addressed by the TOE and the IT Environment. The assumed level of
expertise of the attacker for all the threats identified below is Enhanced-Basic.
The following threats are drawn directly from the [SWAPP]:
ID Threat
T.NETWORK_ATTACK An attacker is positioned on a communications channel or elsewhere on the network
infrastructure. Attackers may engage in communications with the application
software or alter communications between the application software and other
endpoints in order to compromise it.
T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP An attacker is positioned on a communications channel or elsewhere on the network
infrastructure. Attackers may monitor and gain access to data exchanged between
the application and other endpoints.
T.LOCAL_ATTACK An attacker can act through unprivileged software on the same computing platform
on which the application executes. Attackers may provide maliciously formatted
input to the application in the form of files or other local communications.
T.PHYSICAL_ACCESS An attacker may try to access sensitive data at rest.

5.3 Clarification of Scope
All evaluations (and all products) have limitations, as well as potential misconceptions that need
clarifying. This text covers some of the more important limitations and clarifications of this
evaluation. Note that:
ï· As with any evaluation, this evaluation only shows that the evaluated configuration meets
the security claims made, with a certain level of assurance. The level of assurance for this
evaluation is defined within the Protection Profile for Application Software, Version 1.3
[SWAPP v1.3] and Functional Package for Transport Layer Security (TLS), Version 1.1 [TLS-
PKG v1.1].
ï· This evaluation covers only the specific software version identified in this document,
and not any earlier or later versions released or in process.
ï· Consistent with the expectations of the PP, this evaluation did not specifically search for,
nor seriously attempt to counter, vulnerabilities that were not âobviousâ or vulnerabilities
to objectives not claimed in the ST. The CEM defines an âobviousâ vulnerability as one
that is easily exploited with a minimum of understanding of the TOE, technical
sophistication, and resources.
ï· The evaluation of security functionality of the product was limited to the functionality
specified in the claimed PPs. Any additional security related functional capabilities
included in the product were not covered by this evaluation.
ï· The TOE must be installed, configured, and managed as described in the documentation
referenced in section 6 of this Validation Report.

7 TOE Evaluated Configuration
7.1 Evaluated Configuration
The TOE is the Splunk Enterprise v8.1 which is executed on RHEL operating system. The Splunk
Enterprise is a software application that enables users to search, analyze, and visualize the data
that is gathered from various components of an IT infrastructure or business industry. The
evaluated version of the TOE is v8.1.
Figure 1: TOE Boundary Diagram
As noted in Figure 1, The TOE consists of many components: Splunkd, Splunk CLI, Splunk Web,
Splunk Scripts, Splunk alerts, Splunk KeyStore and Splunk config files. Splunkd is the system
process that handles indexing, searching, forwarding, and the Web interface that the user logs
into Splunk Enterprise. The above Figure also shows the TOE uses the underlying host platform
for storing the Scripts, Key store and Config files which are considered part of the application.
Splunk Web is the web-based user interface for the Splunk to manage the application using a
graphical interface. The user logs into Splunk web interface with any supported browser. The
communication between the browser and the Splunk Web is over HTTPS/TLS. An administrator
must authenticate to Splunk Web using the username and password.
Splunkd is the system process that handles indexing, searching, forwarding, and the Web
interface that the user logs into Splunk Enterprise. In order to start this process, the administrator
must start the application by using the command "start splunk" in the application directory.
Splunk CLI provides a command line interface that is used to manage the application locally. The
CLI service is provided by the underlying host platform. It is mainly used to navigate to the
14
application directories and run the Splunk specific commands. It has the same functionality as
Splunk Web except for the graphical representation.
Splunk alerts are actions which gets triggered when a specific criterion is met which is defined by
the user. Different types of alerts can be configured in Splunk. In this evaluation email alerts are
configured that sends an email to the SMTP server when an action is triggered.
Splunk Scripts can be created to automate the Splunk functionality, an administrator can create
simple scripts to start and stop the Splunk application.
Splunk KeyStore is mainly used to store the data for keys, the KeyStore is accessed using the
Gnome keyring. Splunk requires at least two partitions of the underlying platform to be LUKS
encrypted.
Splunk Enterprise configuration settings are stored in configuration files. These files are available
on Splunk with an extension .conf and are easily readable and editable if the user has appropriate
access. Below is the list of Splunk configuration files:
ï· inputs.conf
ï· outputs.conf
ï· server.conf
ï· alert_actions.conf
ï· web.conf
In the evaluated configuration the TOE is configured to act as both Indexer and Forwarder.
Splunk Indexer is a Splunk instance that is installed on the physical Red Hat Enterprise Server and
is configured to receive the data from the Splunk Forwarder instance. The communication
between the Indexer and the Forwarder is over HTTPS/TLS.
Splunk Indexer also communicates with SMTP server for sending email alerts, the communication
between the Indexer and the SMTP server is over HTTPS/TLS.
Splunk Forwarder is a Splunk instance that is installed on the physical Red Hat Enterprise Server
and is configured to send the data to the Splunk Indexer instance. The communication between
the Forwarder and the Indexer is over HTTPS/TLS.
The external trusted data feed is an external data source for transmitting non-TSF related data
to the TOE Indexer for populating Splunkâs datastore.
The external trusted data feed receiver is an external data source for receiving non-TSF related
data from the TOE Forwarder for populating Splunkâs datastore.
In the evaluated configuration, the software was installed on the following hardware:
ï· Dell PowerEdge R430 Server with Intel Xeon E5-2630 v4 (Broadwell)
Note: The TOE is the application software only. The host platforms are not part of the evaluation.
